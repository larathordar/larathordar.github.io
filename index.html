  <h1> New life in Stockholm</h1>

  <p>Moving to Stockholm has been a wonderful decision for me. It's getting darker and colder every day but the christmas lights are shining and the snow lights up the ground. In a way it's a lot like home and much quieter than my former life in London. </p>

<h1>My local library</h1>
<p> My local library is one of the most beautful libraries I've ever seen. It has a big round hall in the centre with books in all sorts of languages. Including Icelandic. I applied for my library card today and I can't wait to spend the cold winter months reading a book or two.</p>
